# If you're not paying for it, you're the product

When I'm being a pompous mansplainer I put forward my three rules of the Internet:

1. If you're not paying for it, you're the product
0. The Internet is written in ink - _Once it's posted, deleting it won't make it go away_
0. Everything on the Internet is public - _Never write a private message or converse in a private forum assuming it won't become public_

The internet content giants are a case in point: Facebook, Google, Twitter, all advertisement brokers. Running the platform is an unavoidable expense in order to put adverts in front of your eyes. And when your eyes go elsewhere, their income stream dries up.

Now, social media is a fickle business. The revenue generating eyes get swept along by bandwagons. Today they're on MySpace or Bebo or whatever, tomorrow they're on Facebook or TikTok. Platforms don't die suddenly, but they stop being new and exciting when something else comes along. Facebook? That's for old people.

We also have the inversion of the publishing pyramid: while traditionally content was scarce and attention was plentiful, now content is limitless and attention is valuable. So the big players, Facebook and Google and Twitter are competing for this attention so they can sell it to advertisers. Which turns all commercial social media into attention grabbing cesspools unless you work hard at keeping your feeds relevant.

Which brings us to Mastodon, which turns our social media habits back to where we came in: a timeline that is ordered chronologically showing only content that you've chosen with no adverts/suggestions. The financial model is entirely voluntary via subscription/contribution. And the code of conduct is federated - you agree to terms when you sign up to an instance, and if the instance administrators make choices you don't like, you go elsewhere.

Will we end up living in echo chambers of people with whom we mostly agree? Possibly, but we will also be in echo chambers of people who extend our experiences by piqueing our interests.


Let's see how it goes :)
