# I was in an accident but it wasn't my fault

Driving a car is lots of things. It's liberating. It's polluting. It can be exhilarating. It can be tiring on a long journey. But it always comes with a grave responsibility.

Most adults pass their driving practical test in their teens or twenties and that's the end of formal learning about driving. As the years go by you build confidence and situational awareness. Many will, at some point, be involved in an accident.

When accidents happen we apportion blame. If insurance companies are involved then this is essential: they have to know whose insurer will pay, and who will lose their no-claims bonus.

Some no-blame accidents are unavoidable. If you're stationary in traffic, correctly positioned on the road, and someone drives into you then it's unavoidable. But there are behaviours that can prevent your being in some sorts of no-blame accidents, such as:

- **Overtaking on the inside**: It's not enough to eschew this dangerous and illegal practice, you have to also check if someone else is doing this
- **Indicator Scepticism**: Sometimes people turn without indicating. Less frequently someone will indicate and not turn. Through my driving career I've always waited for someone to start turning before pulling out in front of their path: on one occasion it prevented an accident
- **Stopping at red lights**: When going through a green light, check if someone's jumping the red light. If you've ever absent mindedly jumped (or nearly jumped) a red light, someone else might do that in front of you

By leaving plenty of space around yourself in moving traffic you allow more time to compensate for both your own and other people's errors. And, though it's probabilities and not absolute, you stand a better chance of not being in someone else's accident.
